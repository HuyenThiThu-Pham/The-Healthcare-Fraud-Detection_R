# The-Healthcare-Fraud-Detection_R
### Introduction

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent interactions in the healthcare industry using machine learning classification models. The dataset used is the Healthcare Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/healthcare-providerfraud-detection-analysis, which provides a rich and detailed view of healthcare providers, their billing practices, patient demographics, and procedures performed.

### The dataset consists of:

- Provider Information: Unique identifiers, location, specialty, and patient demographics.
- Billing Information: Details about medical services billed, including service type, diagnosis, cost, and date.
- Patient Demographics: Age, gender, medical history, and location.
- Procedural Information: Procedure codes, medical necessity, and types of procedures performed.
- Fraud Labels: Indicators of fraudulent claims based on past investigations.
The dataset presents a complex but insightful challenge, requiring data mining techniques, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering to uncover patterns of fraudulent behavior.

### Project Overview

1. Data Exploration & Feature Selection – Analyzing the dataset, visualizing key variables, handling missing values, selecting important features, and scaling data where necessary.
2. Building Classification Models – Implementing four models: Decision Trees, Neural Networks, SVM, Naïve Bayes, KNN methods, with parameter tuning and performance evaluation.
3. Model Comparison & Conclusion – Evaluating models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics to determine the best-performing model. Feature importance analysis is conducted for the top model.

This project demonstrates a systematic approach to fraud detection using machine learning techniques in R.
